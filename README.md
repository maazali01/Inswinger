# StreamHub - Production-Ready Live Streaming Platform

A full-stack, production-ready live streaming platform built with Next.js 13, React, Supabase, and TypeScript. Designed for sports streaming with role-based access, real-time features, and comprehensive SEO.

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- âœ… **Multi-role Authentication System**
  - User signup and login with Supabase Auth
  - Role-based access control (visitor, user, streamer, admin)
  - Streamer signup flow with subscription plan selection
  - Protected routes and server-side authentication

- âœ… **Database Architecture**
  - Comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with 13 tables
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
  - Automated triggers for timestamp updates
  - Optimized indexes for performance
  - Foreign key relationships and data integrity

- âœ… **User Interface**
  - Beautiful, modern homepage with gradient designs
  - Responsive navigation with mobile menu
  - Browse streams page with filtering by category and status
  - User dashboard with watch history and following
  - Streamer dashboard with stream management
  - Subscription plan selection UI

### Database Schema

#### Core Tables
1. **profiles** - Extended user profiles with role-based access
2. **subscription_plans** - Streamer subscription tiers
3. **streamers** - Streamer-specific data and subscription info
4. **streams** - Live and recorded stream content
5. **stream_analytics** - Per-stream metrics and analytics
6. **followers** - User-streamer following relationships
7. **chats** - Real-time chat messages
8. **blogs** - Blog posts with SEO metadata
9. **events** - Sports events calendar
10. **payments** - Payment transaction records
11. **subscriptions** - Subscription history
12. **watch_history** - User viewing history
13. **site_settings** - CMS configuration

### Security & Access Control

All tables have RLS enabled with restrictive policies:
- Users can only view and update their own data
- Streamers can only manage their own streams
- Public content (streams, blogs) is accessible to anonymous users
- Admin operations require admin role verification
- Authentication checks use `auth.uid()` for security

### Technology Stack

**Frontend**
- Next.js 13 (App Router with SSR/SSG support)
- React 18 with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for responsive styling
- shadcn/ui component library
- Lucide React icons

**Backend & Database**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Database triggers and functions
- Type-safe database queries

**State Management**
- React Context for authentication
- React hooks for data fetching
- Server-side rendering where appropriate

- Regular dependency updates
- Security audits
- Penetration testing
- DDoS protection via CDN

## Performance Optimization

### Current
- Code splitting with Next.js
- Lazy loading where appropriate
- Optimized bundle size
- Database indexes

### Recommended
- Implement caching strategy
- Use Next.js Image for optimization
- Add service worker for offline support
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- Optimize database queries
- Add Redis for session caching
- Implement CDN for static assets

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Recommended Setup
- Sentry for error tracking
- Google Analytics or Plausible for user analytics

- Supabase Dashboard for database metrics
- Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot)
- Log aggregation (LogRocket, DataDog)

## Support & Documentation

### Creating an Admin Account

To create an admin account:

1. Sign up as a regular user
2. In Supabase Dashboard, go to Table Editor > profiles
3. Find your user and change `role` to `admin`
4. Log out and log back in
5. You'll now have access to `/admin` route

### Common Issues

**Build Warnings**
- `metadataBase` warning is cosmetic and can be ignored in development
- Supabase Realtime dependency warning is normal

**Authentication Issues**
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Check Supabase project status
- Verify environment variables
